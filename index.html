    <h1>A YELLOW PRECIOUS METAL</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Gold was generally used for a couple thousand years solely to create
      things such as jewelry and idols for worship.
    </p>

    <h2>Gold: The Most Precious of Metals</h2>

    <p>
      This was until around 1500 BC when the ancient empire of Egypt, which
      benefited greatly from its gold-bearing region, Nubia, made gold the first
      official medium of exchange for international trade.

      is long connected with money, but gold relinquished this role in developed

        the Bretton Woods monetary system</a

      in 1971 when the US unilaterally ended its gold standard, which set the
      convertibility of gold and the dollar to US$35 per ounce.

    <h3>Some Summary of Gold</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>Gold</summary>
      <p>
        Gold (element #79, symbol Au) is a heavy, shiny yellow metal. It is
        probably the oldest precious metal known to humans. Wars have been
        fought over it and countless numbers have died trying to gain it or
        protect it.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Description</summary>
      <p>
        Its physical and chemical properties make it ideal for a number of
        applications. It is used in dentistry and medicine, in jewelry and arts,
        in medallions and coins, in ingots as a store of value, for scientific
        and electronic instruments
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Relation to Mining</summary>
      <p>
        Gold is found in two major types of deposits. Lode deposits are where
        gold is found in veins in rock. The second type is called a placer
        deposit that is formed by moving water that has eroded gold out of lode
        deposits.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!--<del>,<ins>, tag/elements used -->
    <p>
      Gold was highly valued by early civilizations for its scarcity, durability
      and characteristic color, reminiscent of the sun, which was worshiped by
      some as a deity. It was first recovered from streambed gravels (placers),
      <del> where it occurred in native form</del>, and thus did not require
      extraction from ores.
      <del> It was both essentially indestructible and easily worked</del>.
      <ins>
        Gold nuggets were prized
        <em>
          possessions that could be fashioned into bars of different standard
          weights</em
        >
        and into ornaments and items of adornment that also served as portable
        wealth</ins
      >. Gold leaf (gold beaten into thin sheets) has been used to decorate
      significant architectural structures since ancient times. In the 7th
      century B.C., the Etruscans used gold to make false teeth, and it is still
      used in dentistry today due to its nontoxicity, durability and beauty.
